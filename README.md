<h1> Hi, I'm Larion. I build detection workflows and analyze logs in my SOC home lab to develop real-world blue team skills. </a> 

<h2> About Me </h2>

Hi, I‚Äôm Larion ‚Äî an aspiring SOC analyst with a strong interest in threat detection, log analysis, and defensive security. I‚Äôve been building a dedicated home lab where I investigate suspicious activity, create detection rules, and simulate real-world attack scenarios using tools like Splunk, pfSense, and Velociraptor.

I‚Äôm focused on blue team operations and enjoy working with logs, network traffic, and endpoint data to identify patterns, respond to alerts, and improve visibility across systems. I‚Äôve documented SOC-style projects that include brute-force detection, PowerShell anomaly identification, and firewall-based threat blocking.

Currently, I‚Äôm preparing for the **Blue Team Level 1 (BTL1)** certification while gaining practical experience through hands-on labs, platforms like TryHackMe and Blue Team Labs, and real-world simulation exercises. My goal is to join a SOC team where I can contribute to monitoring, triage, and continuous improvement of security operations.

If you're interested in defensive security, threat hunting, or SOC tooling ‚Äî let‚Äôs connect.


   <h2> Personal Projects </h2>

- [üîéKali Nmap Localhost Scan](https://github.com/Larionm/kali-nmap-localhost-scan)  
  Performed a basic recon scan using Nmap inside a Kali Linux lab environment. Saved results, documented findings, and practiced port/service enumeration.

 - **[üì°Metasploitable 2 Nmap Recon](https://github.com/Larionm/metasploitable-nmap-recon/tree/main)**
   Nmap scan and analysis of a vulnerable VM. Identified insecure services and documented results as part of a threat hunting lab exercise.

 - [üößpfSense Firewall with pfBlockerNG](https://github.com/Larionm/pfsense-firewall-lab)  
Built a virtual perimeter firewall using pfSense and pfBlockerNG. Created firewall rules to block ICMP and SSH traffic, enabled DNSBL for ad/malware domain filtering, and validated defenses with test traffic from Kali Linux. Included log analysis, screenshots, and threat feed configuration in a fully documented GitHub lab.

- **[üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Windows Log Triage ‚Äì Privilege Escalation Detection](https://github.com/Larionm/windows-log-analysis-soc-triage)**  
*A SOC-style investigation of Event ID 4672 to identify high-level privilege assignments. Assessed potential for abuse of SeDebugPrivilege and SeImpersonatePrivilege on a local system.*

- [üìä Brute-Force Detection with Splunk (Event ID 4625)](https://github.com/Larionm/splunk-bruteforce-detection)
A simulated detection of multiple failed login attempts using SPL and log analysis.


  
## Tools & Technologies I've Worked With:

### Systems & Environments
- Kali Linux ‚Äì Used for recon, enumeration, and simulated attacks
- Metasploitable 2 ‚Äì Vulnerable VM used for practicing Nmap and Metasploit scans
- VirtualBox ‚Äì Managed multiple VMs for firewall, SIEM, and endpoint monitoring labs
- Ubuntu ‚Äì Used as host environment for Velociraptor and general lab testing

### Detection & Analysis
- Splunk ‚Äì Created dashboards and SPL queries for alerting on brute-force and suspicious PowerShell activity
- Windows Event Viewer ‚Äì Manually triaged events like failed logons (4625) and privilege escalation (4672)
- Velociraptor ‚Äì Deployed for live endpoint monitoring and forensic evidence collection (in progress)

### Network & Threat Monitoring
- pfSense ‚Äì Built and configured firewall with LAN/WAN rules and tested threat blocking
- pfBlockerNG ‚Äì Enabled DNSBL and IP blocklists for threat feed filtering and ad/malware blocking
- Nmap ‚Äì Used for network scanning, port/service enumeration, and OS fingerprinting
- Metasploit ‚Äì Used for scanning vulnerabilities and validating recon findings

### Automation & Scripting
- Python ‚Äì Wrote scripts for password generation, GUI tools, and chatbot logic
- Markdown ‚Äì Wrote technical documentation, lab reports, and README files
- Git & GitHub ‚Äì Used for version control, project publishing, and SOC portfolio organization


##  Skills Gained

- Threat Detection ‚Äì Built and tested detection rules in Splunk for brute-force and PowerShell attacks
- Log Analysis ‚Äì Investigated Windows Event Logs (IDs 4625, 4672) for privilege escalation and failed logins
- Network Security ‚Äì Created and tested firewall rules using pfSense and pfBlockerNG
- Endpoint Monitoring ‚Äì Deployed Velociraptor and collected forensic artifacts (in progress)
- Python Scripting ‚Äì Developed secure scripts like a password generator and chatbot for security use cases
- Linux Administration ‚Äì Performed file permission audits and worked with Kali & Ubuntu in virtual labs
- Recon & Enumeration ‚Äì Used Nmap and Metasploit for scanning, OS fingerprinting, and vulnerability analysis
- Documentation ‚Äì Created structured SOC-style documentation using Markdown and GitHub



## Certifications

- Google Cybersecurity Certificate ‚Äì Completed  
- Blue Team Level 1 (BTL1) ‚Äì In progress, focused on SOC operations, detection engineering, and log analysis
