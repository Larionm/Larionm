<h1> Hi, I'm Larion. Nice to meet you. I work as an entry-level cybersecurity analyst. </a> 

<h2> About Me </h2>

Hi there! My name is Larion, and I'm an ambitious and motivated entry-level cybersecurity analyst who is passionate about defending digital systems against online attacks. Despite the fact that my career is just getting started, I have devoted my time to learning, creating projects, and honing my practical abilities in network security, ethical hacking, and vulnerability assessment.

With my solid background in network protocols, Linux security, and automation with Python scripting, I continue to learn more through independent research, security labs, and Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges. Developing a Python vulnerability scanner and doing security audits on test environments are two recent projects that have helped me hone my problem-solving skills.

Right now, my main goals are to become certified in areas like CompTIA Security+ and hone my abilities in cloud security, incident response, and penetration testing. It excites me to join a team where I can develop, contribute, and assist fortify cybersecurity defenses by bringing my analytical approach, enthusiasm to learn, and strong problem-solving abilities.

I'm always up for talking about cybersecurity, picking the brains of specialists in the field, and investigating novel security issues. Let's connect!


<h2> Cybersecuirty Work Samples:</h2>

  - [Conducting a secuirty audit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JlwYH_2xQorQVHZth_jSQftEXXAhC7sCe9Wk7vXGV4s/edit?usp=sharing) Performed a security audit on a fictional companies network/system to identify vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and compliance gaps. Created a detailed report with risk analysis and remediation steps.
  - [File Permissions in Linux](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uZ7Nktnqt3n5AZefyW0Oad4pEJrCblfUN1FRM2wwdJY/edit?usp=sharing)  Explored Linux file permissions, access control, and best security practices. Demonstrated how to secure files using chmod, chown, and umask to prevent unauthorized access.
 - [Algorithm for file updates in python](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Grop9oDtJv3-nti1HgFyT2KU5Hpeq4SdFUSpCor7wZo/edit?usp=sharing) Developed a Python script to securely track and update sensitive files, ensuring data integrity and preventing unauthorized modifications.
 - [Vunerability assessment report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l1WgSuqWw4Y09W6q3CsLbe1dadLK813Cwhiehgo8EHs/edit?usp=sharing) Conducted a simulated vulnerability assessment using tools like Nmap and OpenVAS. Documented findings and recommended security enhancements based on industry best practices.
 - [Apply Filters To SQL queries](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MnopEqtYSqVxqmNB7tr-zJt2hw20uGOdLsLUO3j7Pk8/edit?usp=sharing) Implemented SQL filtering techniques to prevent SQL injection attacks. Demonstrated how input validation and parameterized queries improve database security.
