<h1> Hi, I'm Larion. Nice to meet you. I work as an entry-level cybersecurity analyst. </a> 

<h2> About Me </h2>

Hi there! My name is Larion, and I'm an ambitious and motivated entry-level cybersecurity analyst who is passionate about defending digital systems against online attacks. Although I am at the beginning of my career, I have actively built a strong foundation in network security, ethical hacking, and vulnerability assessment through hands-on projects and continuous learning.

With my solid background in network protocols, Linux security, and automation with Python scripting, I continue to learn more through independent research, security labs, and Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges. Developing a Python vulnerability scanner and doing security audits on test environments are two recent projects that have helped me hone my problem-solving skills.

I am currently working toward CompTIA Security+ certification while expanding my expertise in cloud security, incident response, and penetration testing to strengthen my cybersecurity skill set. It excites me to join a team where I can develop, contribute, and assist fortify cybersecurity defenses by bringing my analytical approach, enthusiasm to learn, and strong problem-solving abilities.

I'm always up for talking about cybersecurity, picking the brains of specialists in the field, and investigating novel security issues. Let's connect!


<h2> Cybersecuirty Work Samples:</h2>

  - [Conducting a secuirty audit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JlwYH_2xQorQVHZth_jSQftEXXAhC7sCe9Wk7vXGV4s/edit?usp=sharing) Performed a security audit on a fictional companies network/system to identify vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and compliance gaps. Created a detailed report with risk analysis and remediation steps.
  - [File Permissions in Linux](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uZ7Nktnqt3n5AZefyW0Oad4pEJrCblfUN1FRM2wwdJY/edit?usp=sharing)  Explored Linux file permissions, access control, and best security practices. Demonstrated how to secure files using chmod, chown, and umask to prevent unauthorized access.
 - [Algorithm for file updates in python](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Grop9oDtJv3-nti1HgFyT2KU5Hpeq4SdFUSpCor7wZo/edit?usp=sharing) Developed a Python script to securely track and update sensitive files, ensuring data integrity and preventing unauthorized modifications.
 - [Vunerability assessment report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l1WgSuqWw4Y09W6q3CsLbe1dadLK813Cwhiehgo8EHs/edit?usp=sharing) Conducted a simulated vulnerability assessment using tools like Nmap and OpenVAS. Documented findings and recommended security enhancements based on industry best practices.
 - [Apply Filters To SQL queries](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MnopEqtYSqVxqmNB7tr-zJt2hw20uGOdLsLUO3j7Pk8/edit?usp=sharing) Implemented SQL filtering techniques to prevent SQL injection attacks. Demonstrated how input validation and parameterized queries improve database security.

   <h2> Personal Projects </h2>

- **[🔐Secure Password Generator](https://github.com/Larionm/password-generator)**   
  Developed a **secure password generator** with a built-in **strength meter** and **user-friendly GUI** using Python and Tkinter. Ensures strong, randomized passwords with customizable options for security best practices.
  
- **[🛡️Cybersecurity Chatbot](https://github.com/Larionm/cybersecurity-chatbot)**   
  *A chatbot with encrypted logging, real-time threat detection, and security monitoring.*

- [🔎Kali Nmap Localhost Scan](https://github.com/Larionm/kali-nmap-localhost-scan)  
  Performed a basic recon scan using Nmap inside a Kali Linux lab environment. Saved results, documented findings, and practiced port/service enumeration.

 - **[📡Metasploitable 2 Nmap Recon](https://github.com/Larionm/metasploitable-nmap-recon/tree/main)**
   Nmap scan and analysis of a vulnerable VM. Identified insecure services and documented results as part of a threat hunting lab exercise.

- **[🕵️‍♂️ Windows Log Triage – Privilege Escalation Detection](https://github.com/Larionm/windows-log-analysis-soc-triage)**  
*A SOC-style investigation of Event ID 4672 to identify high-level privilege assignments. Assessed potential for abuse of SeDebugPrivilege and SeImpersonatePrivilege on a local system.*
