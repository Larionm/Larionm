<h1> Hi, I'm Larion. Nice to meet you. I work as an entry-level cybersecurity analyst. </a> 

<h2> About Me </h2>

Hi there! My name is Larion, and I'm an ambitious and motivated entry-level cybersecurity analyst who is passionate about defending digital systems against online attacks. Although I am at the beginning of my career, I have actively built a strong foundation in network security, ethical hacking, and vulnerability assessment through hands-on projects and continuous learning.

With my solid background in network protocols, Linux security, and automation with Python scripting, I continue to learn more through independent research, security labs, and Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges. Developing a Python vulnerability scanner and doing security audits on test environments are two recent projects that have helped me hone my problem-solving skills.

I am currently working toward CompTIA Security+ certification while expanding my expertise in cloud security, incident response, and penetration testing to strengthen my cybersecurity skill set. It excites me to join a team where I can develop, contribute, and assist fortify cybersecurity defenses by bringing my analytical approach, enthusiasm to learn, and strong problem-solving abilities.

I'm always up for talking about cybersecurity, picking the brains of specialists in the field, and investigating novel security issues. Let's connect!
